1iffgf8,The S25 Ultra experience,"The last three years i upgraded my Samsung Note mobile after using many years mostly iPhones. 2 days ago i received my S25 Ultra after using the S24 Ultra for one year. I was very displeased with the removal of the bluetooth functionality in the Spen, but to be honest i did not use it very much. After now owning the phone for this 2 days i can safely say Samsung fixed two very important points. The Screen on the S24 Ultra phones was not very good. From grain to weak gradients it seemed more like a cheap oled screen, not like a high end one. This has absolutely changed with the S25 Ultra. The screen is sharper, more vibrant and less reflective. The difference is really visible. HDR videos pop like i seldom saw them pop. Its like night and day. The Fluidity of the screen and operating system is really stupid fast. The speakers are also much better. I have issues with my hearing (tinnitus)but i can clearly hear a audible difference. The sound is richer, louder and more pronounced. I can leave the volume slider on 20% and have the same experience as if i have the slider on 50% with the S24 Ultra. The S24 Ultra regularly got inexplicably hot and i hade to kill all activity to get it back in check. The S25 Ultra got not one time warm even while setting the mobile up. The Camera seems to have less issues capturing moving objects. Taking pictures of my dog was many times challenging with the S24 Ultra because of the relatively slow shutter speed. The S25 Ultra seems to manage this scenarios much better. If the Spen would have bluetooth the S25 Ultra would be easily much the better mobile. People who say its a downgrade will miss out a much better screen.",178,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/1iffgf8/the_s25_ultra_experience/,2025-02-01 17:24:38,201,"{  ""product_name"": ""S25 Ultra"",  ""aspects"": [    {      ""name"": ""Screen Quality"",      ""score"": 1,      ""explanation"": ""The screen on the S25 Ultra is significantly improved compared to the S24 Ultra.
