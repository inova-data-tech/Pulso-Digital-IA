1i6vhfw,"Switched to iPhone After Years of Android, Here's My Honest Take","I've used Android phones all my life, mostly Samsung devices. Seven months ago, I decided to try the iPhone 15 Pro Max.Right off the bat, I can say there’s only one thing I truly loved about it: FaceID... and that’s about it.Here’s a list of things I didn’t like:* **No “Close All Apps” Button:** I miss having a quick way to close all background apps instantly.* **The Keyboard is Awful:** Compared to SwiftKey on Android, the iPhone keyboard feels years behind. Even after downloading SwiftKey on iOS, it’s not the same - there’s no option to resize the keyboard, and in some apps, SwiftKey randomly disappears, leaving me stuck with the default iPhone keyboard.* **Keyboard Sounds Are Buggy:** Sometimes, the sound of keypresses is randomly louder or glitchy, which is extremely annoying.* **Inconsistent Back Gesture:** The back gesture on iPhone is not consistent across apps, and that’s frustrating.* **Cursor Placement:** On Android, I could just tap anywhere in the middle of a word to place the cursor. On iPhone, I have to rely on holding the spacebar for cursor control, which is slower.* **Alarm:** On Android, when I set an alarm, it shows me how many hours are left until it goes off. iPhone doesn’t have this feature, and I really miss it.* **Email Notifications:** On Android, I can read an entire email from the notification bar. On iPhone, I can’t.* **Apple's Interface:** It's great having good hardware, but what's the point if the User Interface is so frustratingly slow? I even enabled ""Reduce Motion"". I get it, the animations are smooth and cool, but the Reduce Motion feature should get rid of all of the animation steps to a setting that I searched for or clicked a shortcut to - and it doesn't. Also scrolling on iPhone is painfully slower when trying to move from the bottom of a page to the top compared to Android.* **Customization:** Most of you are probably tired of hearing this over and over again, but I got to say this. All those pixels, and I can't even change how many apps there are on my screen. My grandparents wouldn't care for sure, they wont even be able to see smaller icons, but I care. I would like to have more apps on my screen, smaller ones. I don't want to be limited, when there are better alternatives on the market. It's like buying an expensive car, but then you find out you can buy another one from a different brand, for the same price, which has a ton of more features, but they're both advertised as ""supercars"".I could go on for an hour listing more reasons why for me, Android is better than iOS. Can’t wait to switch back - I’ll probably grab the Galaxy S25 when it drops.What are your thoughts? Anyone else had a similar experience?",2775,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/1i6vhfw/switched_to_iphone_after_years_of_android_heres/,2025-01-21 19:36:22,1020,"{  ""nome_do_produto"": ""iPhone 15 Pro Max"",  ""aspectos"": [    {      ""nome"": ""FaceID"",      ""nota"": 1,      ""explicacao"": ""The FaceID feature is highly praised for its convenience and speed in unlocking the device.""    },    {      ""nome"": ""No 'Close All Apps' Button"",      ""nota"": -1,      ""explicacao"": ""The lack of a quick way to close all background apps is a significant inconvenience compared to Android.""    },    {      ""nome"": ""Keyboard"",      ""nota"": -1,      ""explicacao"": ""The iPhone keyboard is considered inferior to SwiftKey on Android, with issues like lack of resizing options and occasional disappearance.""    },    {      ""nome"": ""Keyboard Sounds"",      ""nota"": -1,      ""explicacao"": ""The keypress sounds on the iPhone are sometimes glitchy and louder, which can be very annoying.""    },    {      ""nome"": ""Inconsistent Back Gesture"",      ""nota"": -1,      ""explicacao"": ""The back gesture on iPhone is not consistent across different apps, leading to frustration.""    },    {      ""nome"": ""Cursor Placement"",      ""nota"": -1,      ""explicacao"": ""Placing the cursor in the middle of a word is more cumbersome on iPhone compared to Android.""    },    {      ""nome"": ""Alarm"",      ""nota"": -1,      ""explicacao"": ""The iPhone does not show the remaining time until an alarm goes off, a feature that is available on Android.""    },    {      ""nome"": ""Email Notifications"",      ""nota"": -1,      ""explicacao"": ""On iPhone, you cannot read the entire email from the notification bar, unlike on Android.""    },    {      ""nome"": ""User Interface"",      ""nota"": -1,      ""explicacao"": ""The iPhone's user interface is perceived as frustratingly slow, even with the 'Reduce Motion' feature enabled.""    },    {      ""nome"": ""Customization"",      ""nota"": -1,      ""explicacao"": ""The lack of customization options, such as the ability to change the number of apps on the screen, is a significant drawback.""    }  ]}"
