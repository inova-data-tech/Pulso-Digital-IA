1iffgf8,"I have found that the 5g antenna on my s25 ultra is soooo much better than my old S24 ultra. I'm getting good signal in places where I got no signal at all and from my apartment I now get 815 megabits down where I used to get much lower (around 350 Mb/s). I just chalked it up to crappy T-Mobile service here.I also find the screen to be way better. The colors pop more and it seems like it is sharper. The more I use it, the more I find it much better than my old ultra. Even scrolling on some applications is much smoother.

1iffgf8,"I miss square corners and of course the lack of Bluetooth on the pen is a little bit irritating but the only time I really used to it was when taking photos where I wanted to hold the phone as far away as possible so that I can get more in a selfie or if I wanted to set the phone down and get a photo far away and take the picture remotely, but 90% of the time I forgot.I absolutely enjoy the display. As you said it is sharper the colors are better and overall it is a lot nicer. In addition I took photos in various situations and did a blind test with my wife and between the s24 I'll try and the s25 ultra every single time she chose the s25 that's the better photo.And I don't know what it is but I play Call of Duty mobile a lot and the graphics are just sharper and more detailed and it's just fantastic., I also enjoy the updated operating system visuals. And there are just things I am still finding all over the place that I like. Another small thing that nobody else has mentioned is the buttons on the side are much easier to press and it is just nice for me to click the button very easily.I also agree on the sound. It does feel more rich like you said and also gets louder.Another thing to mention is the fingerprint scanner is super accurate and covers a larger area. When it is recording your fingerprints it moves the circle around slightly all over and makes you scan it in that location. I didn't notice that on the s24. Also with the screen being brighter and sharper and clear there is another option in brightness settings that you can actually set even brighter and of course it warns you that it takes more battery usage but it's interesting to see it there.So many people I know have the display very very Dim when they are using their phone but I have always been one that loves the brightness and the Vibrance of the colors.I have the green color of the phone and I really like it. It is not something that I have had before.Also just while I am talking about things I highly recommend the products that I got for it from amazon. I got a Torras magsafe clear case with stand and also a green wallet that goes with it. I had the s24 equivalence previously but the wallet was blue.In addition I got the Torras tempered glass that you can just put the cover over your phone and then pull out a sheet drops the tempered glass screen protector onto your phone. It worked so perfect I didn't realize that it actually had put the screen protector on the phone and I looked to see what had gone wrong and then I actually looked very closer to my phone and with my finger now felt the edge of the screen protector on the phone. It was fantastic.I have become a huge fan of that brand. I have used several of their cases and also they let me test a case. They actually emailed me and said that they wanted some testers for new products.https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D16YLYM9?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_shareTORRAS 12FT Military-Grade... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DN6YLW7Q?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_sharehttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DN5FCQSZ?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share",22,2025-02-01 18:55:00,"{  ""product_name"": ""S25 Ultra"",  ""aspects"": [    {      ""name"": ""Square Corners"",      ""score"": -1,      ""explanation"": ""The user misses the square corners, indicating a preference for the design of previous models.""    },    {      ""name"": ""Bluetooth Pen"",      ""score"": -1,      ""explanation"": ""The lack of Bluetooth on the pen is irritating, especially for remote photo taking.""    },    {      ""name"": ""Display Quality"",      ""score"": 1,      ""explanation"": ""The user absolutely enjoys the display, noting that it is sharper, has better colors, and is overall nicer.""    },    {      ""name"": ""Camera Quality"",      ""score"": 1,      ""explanation"": ""In a blind test, the user's wife consistently chose photos taken with the S25 Ultra over those taken with the S24.""    },    {      ""name"": ""Game Graphics"",      ""score"": 1,      ""explanation"": ""The user finds that the graphics in Call of Duty Mobile are sharper and more detailed on the S25 Ultra.""    },    {      ""name"": ""Operating System"",      ""score"": 1,      ""explanation"": ""The user enjoys the updated operating system visuals and finds new features they like.""    },    {      ""name"": ""Button Ease"",      ""score"": 1,      ""explanation"": ""The buttons on the side are much easier to press, making the user's experience more pleasant.""    },    {      ""name"": ""Sound Quality"",      ""score"": 1,      ""explanation"": ""The sound is richer and gets louder, enhancing the user's audio experience.""    },    {      ""name"": ""Fingerprint Scanner"",      ""score"": 1,      ""explanation"": ""The fingerprint scanner is super accurate and covers a larger area, improving security and convenience.""    },    {      ""name"": ""Brightness Settings"",      ""score"": 1,      ""explanation"": ""The screen can be set to an even brighter setting, which the user appreciates for its vibrance and clarity.""    },    {      ""name"": ""Phone Color"",      ""score"": 1,      ""explanation"": ""The user likes the green color of the phone, finding it unique and appealing.""    },    {      ""name"": ""Accessories"",      ""score"": 1,      ""explanation"": ""The user highly recommends the Torras Magsafe clear case with stand and the green wallet, as well as the Torras tempered glass screen protector.""    }  ]}"

1iffgf8,"It's crazy how there are so many arguments from both sides. All that ""not much of an upgrade"" and ""downgrade from the last model"" sound like they're too broke to upgrade and just trying to justify their last purchase was better.I mean I am not really a ""phone"" enthusiastic but I've done my research and I think it's pretty good - especially editing the photos with the AI - you can literally remove any object unbelievably well unlike in iOS 16PM.Not to be biased, I do think that removing Bluetooth feature is such a dumb move even if it's not used that much. It could've been something unique and exciting to play around with.And I also like the square corners that made the previous models stand out and give them a premium look (I do know that the rounded corners are more comfortable).And I saw some YT videos about durability being worse after prying them open - like how the heck uses that badly. If it's the reason for not upgrading, you might just be a stone age barbarian.Now cameras, I do feel like I like the tone on the 16PM better - I think the ""warm"" tone gives it more cinematic and realistic feels to the photos. And if you did research, the stabilization in the iPhone video is definitely better.What actually makes S25 Ultra cameras better than the iPhone is the zoom and the AI editing feature. Sometimes you just can't get people to move out of the way to take a nice photo. So either of them is just your preference in the end.Though I do like the software on the Samsung better now with the one UI 7, I used to think that android OS is trash compared to the iOS.One thing I'm scared of, is that sometimes new phone releases and then they got errors like infamous iPhone 13PM. But you can not avoid it if you don't wanna observe for a while and get behind on the latest trend.In the end, there's no way S25 Ultra is not worth upgrading especially if you can trade in.

The 15% increase in processing power (and battery drain, mind you) plus some obscure camera improvements are just not enough to call this an upgrade. An update, maybe but, even if this was an S24 Ultra SE and they offered it to me for free, I would still forgo it until the next iteration, a truly new phone, with a brighter screen, Qualcomm's 3d Max fingerprint reader or some FACEID ripoff, Bluetooth put back into the Spen and a bigger battery that can justify putting such a power hungry processor. Also a better camera, with a bigger optical zoom range. I upgraded every phone from Galaxy s2 and this was the first time I sent both back because they're not different enough and my processor and battery are quick enough and hold enough charge for me to not be able to justify spending money on a WORSE device that lacks the features and access my current device offers.I lose the ability to use the S-pen as a remote, can no longer access the engineering menu, android 15 has dumb restrictions that locked me out of all the internal apps I access to improve my experience with T-Mobile, in other words, if you're upgrading from, say, galaxy s10 or s20 then yeah, then it totally makes sense for you but not implementing a better fingerprint sensor and the fact that the iPhone users get a better, newer, much brighter, more energy efficient m14 panel whereas Samsung FLAGSHIP is still stuck with the older m13...

1iffgf8,"My feelings aren’t hurt—hah, what a statement. And no, upgrading each year doesn’t cost me *that* much. I usually spend around $450 annually, and this year it was $422. If you include two years of Samsung Care+ for $49 (prepaid), that brings it to $471—basically $2.04 a month for insurance. That’s an easy yes for me.On top of that, both last year and this year, I bought the Galaxy Watch at a steep discount and resold it for about twice what I paid, which offsets my costs even more. When you break it down, I’m paying around $27 per month for only one year—not a big deal at all.I’m well aware that many software and firmware features get ported to older devices soon after release, and I’m sure some differences are just my perception rather than actual improvements. But hey, there’s no need to be rude about it. I’m not an idiot—I have a strong technical background both professionally and personally. And we’re all human.I’m happy with my new phone, and if you’re happy with whatever device you use, that’s great. (Though, to be honest, you do sound a bit cynical and cranky and not happy.)     I’m not running tests to prove anything to people online—I got the S25 Ultra, I’m enjoying it, and I’m testing it out.I sent my wife 12 blind photo comparisons, and in every single one, she preferred the S25 Ultra. She didn’t know which was which, and I sent them in no particular order. In a couple of cases, I had to examine the details closely to understand what she liked better, but in the end, I agreed. And for most of them, my preference was immediate.Someone also mentioned how much snappier and crisp the S25 Ultra feels—I agree. But I also recognize that any fresh install will make a device run faster, whether it’s a phone or a computer. That’s why I reinstall Windows every six months.

I know that because I have done hours of comparison with both 14PM and 16PM. But i was too bored of ios and wanted a change and also got a super good deal on S25U, so made the switch.
