1i6vhfw,"I am in a similar boat. Got the iPhone 16 plus after years of using Android (I did use the first 3 iPhones) just to change it up. I can say that iOS is not user friendly, I understand people get used to it and it becomes second nature but the fact still stands that iOS is backwards and not user friendly.One of the things I dislike the most is the lack of a universal back button/gesture. Also dislike you can't simply tap to place a cursor in between characters and the lack of a universal select all when highlighting a word. Another big one is the crappy notification system on iOS, the way it groups notifications and how it allows (or doesn't) you to dismiss them. Not mention all the glitches that I've encountered like apps freezing, keyboard  disappearing etc.Android just does things in a more straight forward way and has much more intuitive user interface and experience. It feels like iOS has evolved much much slower and grandfathered in poor user experience choices so as to not alienate part of the user base or leadership is lazy and prefers legacy. Apple should just copy the best practices from Android like its notification system.The only good things iOS has from most  important to least is FaceID, the MagSafe ecosystem, and FaceTime/iMessage. Google had something similar to iMessage but has kept abandoning apps and adopting new ones instead of consolidating them and sticking to a single app name like Google chat...multiple missed opportunities on their part.",39,2025-01-22 00:09:44,"{  ""nome_do_produto"": ""iPhone 16 Plus"",  ""aspectos"": [    {      ""nome"": ""User-Friendly Interface"",      ""nota"": -1,      ""explicacao"": ""The iOS interface is not as user-friendly as Android.

1i6vhfw,"Fair points but for me the biggest Apple bs of iOS is: file management, especially photos. iOS mindlessly throws every photo into one storage regardless of its type and where it is from, while Android separately stores photos by apps/folders automatically. It's such a pain to organize them and find a photo that you're looking for. Backing them up to a Windows PC is another disaster if you do this frequently. Their naming scheme is also weird af. Whether it is a photo you took, a random image downloaded from the internet, or a screenshot, they're all being named sth like ""IMG\_0000"". Once I had more than 9999 photos in my iPhone, it started to name photos like ""IMG\_0000 (1)"".

1i6vhfw,I tried switching to iPhone around when IPhone XR came out.   I was using the S7 edge and my history was (iPhone 3GS to S4 to S7 Edge).I was quite excited for the iPhone XR as it was my first phone that I paid full price for and was one of the recently released phone at the time.  How ever that phone was just awful.  It had some weird issues of just rebooting on its own.  Not only that but the switch from Android to Apple was horrible because I lost all of my messages and Whatsapp history.  So I had to start over. After two or three months I just had it enough.  I went back to my S7 edge and patiently waited for Note10+.  I preordered it and I can tell you this phone is worth every single penny.  Still use it every day and still absolutely love it!!!   Debating whether to upgrade to s25 ultra or just replace battery and charging port. Anyway there's no way I can get an iPhone.  Samsung would have to really do something absolutely stupid to make me switch and even then I'd likely switch to Pixel than Apple.,9,2025-01-21 20:59:33,"{  ""nome_do_produto"": ""iPhone XR"",  ""aspectos"": [    {      ""nome"": ""Performance"",      ""nota"": -1,      ""explicacao"": ""The phone had issues of rebooting on its own, which significantly impacted the user experience and reliability.""    },    {      ""nome"": ""Data Transfer"",      ""nota"": -1,      ""explicacao"": ""Switching from Android to iOS resulted in the loss of all messages and WhatsApp history, causing inconvenience and frustration.""    },    {      ""nome"": ""User Experience"",      ""nota"": -1,      ""explicacao"": ""The transition from Android to iOS was difficult and required starting over, which was a significant drawback for the user.""    },    {      ""nome"": ""Value for Money"",      ""nota"": -1,      ""explicacao"": ""The user felt that the iPhone XR was not worth the full price they paid, especially given the issues and the better experience with their previous Android device.""    },    {      ""nome"": ""Overall Satisfaction"",      ""nota"": -1,      ""explicacao"": ""The user was ultimately dissatisfied with the iPhone XR and decided to return to their previous Android device after a few months.""    }  ]}"

1i6vhfw,"I never had an Android phone, but had iPhones since the very first model.My takes on your points:- Close all apps would be great agreed- Keyboard: Whenever I was handed an Android phone from a friend or colleague to write something, everything was off. I was slow, always looking for things to find on em. Not saying it’s better than Android just saying it’s different, so probably that’s your problem too, just got to get used to it- Keyboard sounds are indeed buggy but my phone is on silent constatly for years, so never hear them ever. Buggy or not they are annoying anyhow.- Back gesture as in swiping the screen so it goes back a page? Never had a problem with that- Cursor placement: you can use it by tapping the screen and holding it, a magnifier will come up and you can move it, or the spacebar mode yes, both methods work, no problems with either for me- Alarm: I mean sure, sounds pointless, but sure they could add it- email notif: If I want to read it completetly that is because I want to answer it. And for that I’d open it anyways. What do I get by reading it in the notification instead of the app? Idk, but sure they could add it- Interface: i don’t know what you mean, on 120hz models it’s super fast, and Android still has the choppy scrolling problems on any phone even flagship Samsung ones, while on an iPhone if you scroll it scrolls smoothly- Customization: are you familiar with the concept in marketing, where having less option actually get you more customers? For example at burger places, if you have 2 option you are rolling in orders, when there are 300 options people just stop caring because too many choices. I feel the same with my phone. I don’t WANT to customize it, give me a fix framework which I’ll believe is the best the engineers could come up with, and I’ll learn it and use it. Never had a thought of “hmm wish I could customize this or that”. Just give it to me as is, and it’ll be good. Of course, to each their own.

You remember when microsoft switched from ""My Computer"", to ""This pc"" with windows 10, people asked why? The popular (and probably most accurate) answer was ""Because if you installed win10, this computer is not yours anymore"". Apple was built on this principle from the very start. It has one advantage, sure - iphones have a ""longer lifespan"", than most android phones. Even years later any iphone will work more or less the same as it was when you got it, unlike androids, that tend to get slower, the OS tends to bloat, so on and so forth.

And I can't accept that. Until now, when my parents need my help with their passed down iPhones from my sister, I still find myself incredibly annoyed at their interface. But the biggest issue I have about Apple is their blatant abuse of their customers and maximising profit as much as possible from their fan base. Lightning for devices claiming better performance. Then suddenly type c on one end and lightning on the other. Then suddenly type c on both ends is better for ipads. But not iPhones. Then type c for iPhones as well. Are their charging tech any worse now? It was slow charging before, it's still slow now. Removing the charger from the box claiming environmental reasons and then asking you to pay premium to buy it separately when 90% of the other manufacturers use a universal standard type c. Which is better for the environment?Heck it's even challenging to find a compatible card reader. Want it to work perfectly? Buy the one they sell at a premium.

1i6vhfw,"The argument around “close all apps” on Android versus the lack of an equivalent feature on iPhone revolves around how each operating system manages background apps and system resources. Here’s a breakdown you can use in your discussion:Key Points About Background Apps1.Background App Management Differences (iOS vs. Android):•iOS (No “Close All” Feature): iOS is designed to automatically manage background apps using its memory management system. Apps that are not actively in use are put into a “frozen” state, where they don’t use CPU or drain battery significantly. Force-closing apps on iOS can actually hurt performance because reopening those apps uses more resources than leaving them in the background.•Android (“Close All” Option): Android gives users more control, including the “close all apps” feature. However, modern Android versions (like iOS) are also built to manage memory and battery efficiently without needing manual intervention.2.Impact on Performance:•Closing all apps rarely improves performance on either operating system because:•Cached apps in memory speed up reloading when reopened.•Force-closing apps requires the OS to restart the app entirely, which uses more CPU and battery than resuming from a cached state.•Exceptions:•If a poorly optimized app is actively running in the background, consuming excessive resources, manually closing it might help.•If your phone is low on memory (RAM), manually closing apps can free up resources temporarily.3.Battery Life:•Apps left in the background don’t significantly drain battery unless they’re actively performing tasks (e.g., GPS tracking or playing audio).•Constantly force-closing apps and reopening them can drain more battery than leaving them idle.4.Why Android Has “Close All”:•Android caters to a broader range of user preferences and hardware. On devices with limited resources, “close all” may feel like a practical way to regain control, even if modern Android is designed to handle this automatically.5.Placebo Effect:•Many users feel that closing apps improves performance because it appears to free up RAM or clear clutter. In reality, modern operating systems are designed to manage this efficiently without manual intervention.Summary ArgumentiOS avoids the “close all” feature because it prioritizes user convenience and battery efficiency by relying on its advanced memory management system. Android includes the feature to cater to user preferences and situations where manual control feels necessary, though its modern OS also doesn’t require it. Closing all apps is rarely beneficial and can sometimes harm performance and battery life.In essence, both systems are designed to handle background apps in a way that minimizes the need for manual app management, even if user habits suggest otherwise.",2,2025-01-24 03:43:36,"{  ""nome_do_produto"": ""iPhone"",  ""aspectos"": [    {      ""nome"": ""Background App Management"",      ""nota"": 1,      ""explicacao"": ""iOS is designed to automatically manage background apps, which generally leads to better performance and battery efficiency without the need for users to manually close apps.""    },    {      ""nome"": ""User Convenience"",      ""nota"": 1,      ""explicacao"": ""The lack of a 'close all' feature in iOS simplifies the user experience, as the system handles app management, reducing the need for manual intervention.""    },    {      ""nome"": ""Battery Efficiency"",      ""nota"": 1,      ""explicacao"": ""Apps in the background on iOS are put into a 'frozen' state, which minimizes battery drain and ensures that reopening them is quick and efficient.""    },    {      ""nome"": ""Performance Impact"",      ""nota"": 0,      ""explicacao"": ""Force-closing apps on iOS can actually hurt performance because reopening them uses more resources than leaving them in the background.""    },    {      ""nome"": ""User Control"",      ""nota"": -1,      ""explicacao"": ""Some users might feel a lack of control over their device without the ability to manually close apps, which can be a drawback for those who prefer more hands-on management.""    },    {      ""nome"": ""Placebo Effect"",      ""nota"": -1,      ""explicacao"": ""Many users believe that closing apps improves performance, even though modern operating systems like iOS manage this efficiently without manual intervention.""    }  ]}"
